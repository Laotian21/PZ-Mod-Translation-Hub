Delilah\n\nStep back in time to a more elegant, simpler period in history when you board the luxury sternwheel steamship Delilah for this extravagant pleasure cruise celebrating both the exciting Independence Day holiday and our ship's own centennial.\n\nP.S. Delilah was constructed in Pittsburgh, PA, in 1893 as a revenue steamer ferrying passengers up and down the majestic Ohio River. In 1967, a fire destroyed much of the ship's superstructure and threatened her with scrapping. However after a generous grant to the Friends of Delilah by a Louisville-based benefactor, our proud ship was restored in 1984 and returned to its rightful place as a shining gem among the paddlewheel steamships of the upper Mississippi system.\n\nToday the P.S. Delilah cruises the pristine Ohio River along one of its most verdant stretches, navigating between Brandenburg and Louisville, KY, with exciting views of riverfront New Albany, IN, as the ship circles back under the grand Sherman Minton Bridge. Operated by Friends of Delilah, LLC, the P.S. Delilah makes for a beautiful and thoughtfully curated venue for your party, function, or any other gathering.\n\nThis Independence Day, the Friends of Delilah invite you to join us for a five-hour dinner excursion, leaving port in Brandenburg at 5 PM and returning around 10 PM. Live music, fresh-cooked food, and dancing will be on the itinerary as the P.S. Delilah gently glides along the banks of Knox Country, lit up in the warm and mesmerizing glow of fireworks displays challenging even the Moon in their brightness and majesty.\n\nBook your spot to partake in this once-in-a-lifetime event now. Tickets begin at $150. First come, first served. Friends of Delilah, LLC, is not responsible for the health or safety of individuals or parties aboard the historic P.S. Delilah.

I'd been planning out a raid on the police station, I wanted to see if there was any ammo or whatnot left behind. I didn't get past the bend in the highway before I started having corpses bouncing off my hood. They started converging on me, and the more I tried to push on the more I ran into. I won't lie, that shit was hairy. Even with all the armor on my car, if too many of them piled up on me I'd never be able to get out of there.\n\nProbably end up getting stuck tryna drive over piles of guts n shit. So I whipped a quick spin and booked it back south as fast as I could... But I'm not stupid. I know damn well that pretty soon, alllll the freaks from West Point are gonna start stumbling here, and it'll come to a point of me needing to figure out real quick if I wanna stay or go. I REFUSE to be eaten, REFUSE to turn into one of those things, REFUSE to go out like that. I've spent a lot of time fortifying, stocking up, but if it comes down to me vs. a thousand-strong herd of walking corpses, I'm choosing me, no matter what I have to leave behind.\n\nI might as well start packing the trunk and back seat with gear and supplies... I might or might not have enough ammo to take on a herd, but I don't intend to burn through it all to find out. Besides.... At this point, I'd rather save my ammo for other people than the dead ones. I've already had one shootout, their bodies are still rotting out in the street; I run over em every time I go for a drive.\n\nNow that was a story... I think it was... two weeks ago? I wasn't keeping track of the days until now to be honest. I was still in a moody mood from losing the Doc and Alex (fuck Oscar, dumb idiot), and being alone. I go walking out the clinic one day to poke my head around, maybe hit up the bar, see if I can't get something to drink, when out of nowhere a car pulls up. They don't spot me at first. I tensed up, won't lie. Froze on the spot for a sec, rifle slung over my back, pistol on my hip. They got out, four of em.\n\nOne had a metal baseball bat, one had a fireaxe, and two were toting Glocks and machetes. They start looking around the houses first, maybe one of em was from around here, I don't know, but that all changed when one looked down the street and stopped right at me. I guess his silence told the rest of them something was up, because then they ALL looked at me.\n\nKeep in mind... I've been doing shooting competitions, especially fast draw, since I was 10. I'm 24 now, with combat experience to boot from Desert Storm. Anyway... I suppose from the beginning these guys decided that the gear I had was worth the risk, and their moral compasses. We all stood there, staring at each other likes deer in headlights, until the tall one on the side of the car facing me goes for his gun. The other guy does the same, and then axe and bat guy jump to get out of the way-- smart.\n\nProblem is, the driver and other guy didn't even clear their holsters before I dropped em, one shot each. Closer guy wasn't dead though, he starts crying out and tries to pick up his gun now that he'd dropped it. His buddy with the bat also tries to go for it. I pop him first, like three times, he falls down, pistol guy manages to get his gun up. He starts shooting wildly at me, clearly had no aim, but I still ran for cover behind a wall anyway. Instinct I guess.\n\nAxe guy in that time runs back into the fold to get dead driver's piece, and helps his buddy back up. They both start popping rounds at my general direction, but the whole time I've been going round the other side to flank them in the alley, and it works. Pop pop, pop pop, both are dead. I go to grab their guns and search them, and right as I'm packing everything up, the corpses come stumbling out of the woods.\n\nWell, now it's been two weeks, and it's been mostly quiet in the streets, but that's all about to change here soon. I dunno how long it'll take em to shuffle from the bend in the road to here, but I'm seriously wondering if I REALLY want to be here when they show up.",

The noise attracted a nearby zombie, and as it stumbled towards me, I did the only thing I could think of-I threw a banana at it.\n\nYes, a banana!

That zombie went down faster than a sack of potatoes. I couldn't help but burst into laughter while it flailed around on the slippery floor.\n\nI know, I know, it's a strange and absurd tactic, but desperate times call for desperate measures, right?

Yes, you heard that right! I hit the jackpot in the midst of chaos.

But there's something oddly hilarious about trying to take care of business while the world is falling apart outside.

Counting tiles on the wall, playing toilet paper basketball, or even having conversations with myself to maintain some form of sanity. It's a one-person sitcom in here!\n\nI must say, though, the bathroom has become my sanctuary. It's the one place where I can escape the chaos, even if only for a few minutes.

Though, at the time, we did not know any better.\n\nThree days later, our neighbors can be seen packing in a hurry, as if we were at war. Well, the man in that house is a military man; surely he must know something. As I approached him and asked, he only replied with a chilling word and a stern look, "Pack up and leave now". Before I could even ask any further questions, the man simply drove off with his family in such a hurry that I'm surprised he wasn't stopped by a police officer for breaking at least a few dozen traffic laws.

Military infantry and vehicles flooded the streets, and jets flew by. The ground shook often, as if they were aftershocks of an earthquake.\n\nWithout hesitation, I ordered Hannah to get the kids and pack the essentials. She argues with me still, wanting to stay. I had to slap her; never had I done that to my wife, but this was serious. After calming her down, I instruct her once again, "Grab the kids and pack clothes, food, and water". I rush upstairs to grab my registered Beretta M9 pistol; hopefully I don't need to use it on anyone. I hear gunshots outside the window, my god... A firefighter just smashed someone's head in with a crowbar!\n\nHannah is waiting at the front door with me and our two kids. The children are scared and asking dozens of questions, which I ignore and order everyone to get inside the car.

When I heard the chaos unfolding in Kentucky, I knew right away what I had to do. After all, I have no family or friends to worry about. As my job required me to keep an eye on wildlife and people. But, thanks to my training, I am able to fend for myself out here. As long as nature provides.\n\nNovember 19th, 1993\nI was out foraging this morning when I noticed two of those things slowly making their way towards my cabin. What could have drawn them there? Perhaps Rust? I took them out quietly with a shovel, as I did not want to use my hunting rifle. In case there were more of them. Rust was nowhere near the cabin, but instead out in the forest hunting squirrels, it seems. Leaving the foraged food inside, I check the corpses for anything useful and bury them at least 30 feet away from here.\n\nNovember 28th, 1993\nToday I scored a fair game. A deer. It'll be good to stock up on venison for the winter. However, I'll have an extra mouth to feed. I found this frightened little girl in the forest. This poor child was all alone, dirty, and in ragged clothing. How did she manage to survive all alone out here? It did not matter; I took her in and showed her where she could clean herself up. It's a good thing I had extra clothes lying around from campers who abandoned their belongings in the woods. I fed her soup and sat her by the antique stove to keep her warm. She told me she was only six years old. How cruel can the world get?\n\nDecember 13th, 1993\nAlice-yes, that is her name. She told me a few days later, after she was able to speak properly. She looks healthier now, but her night terrors are still an occurrence. I do my best to take care of her. She keeps good company with Rust. At least I know I can count on him to keep her safe. Often, when I leave to forage or hunt, I remind Alice what to do in case of an emergency as well as to always stay near the cabin. We're short on salt, which is needed for meat preservation. A trip to nearby farm houses shouldn't be too dangerous, as they're far from any major city or town. Other than Ekron.\n\nDecember 14th, 1993\nYesterday, after my trip to acquire some salt and other supplies, I arrived home to find Alice running away in fear from three of those things chasing after her. I quickly got rid of them with my hunting knife and proceeded to clam Alice down. After a few minutes, she explained where they came from. Evidently, some fools had camped up near a river, which makes noise. And since noise attracts these things, well, things did not end well for them, it seems. I think it's time for us to move deeper into the woods. I know of an abandoned cabin that hasn't been used by anyone for almost a decade. It will be far safer there than here. Today, I spent the day packing things up with Alice. Preparing for the journey ahead of us.\n\nDecember 15th, 1993\nMe and Alice are now leaving this cabin. She's been my home for years due to my job. But things aren't the same anymore, and I need to keep this girl safe at all costs. It is my duty as a man and as a ranger.\n\nTo whomever finds this small log of notes: I left one of my hunting rifles under the bed with as little ammunition as I could leave behind. There is enough water in the well, and the antique stove should keep you warm during the winter.\n\nAlice and I will be living deep in the woods, away from all this.

I had to do things I'm not proud of to survive. Abandoned family, friends, and strangers of all kinds. Living in this apartment complex, I managed to stock up on supplies to the point that they are filling up my bedroom with things I've been collecting. Often, when I get out to scavenge at night, I can see those zombies just pacing about. I know, zombies-how cliche. But hey, this is the real deal. It has happened here in Kentucky, of all places! Why do I only go out at night? Because it seems to be safest from both people and zombies. As those things can't be clearly seen when it is completely dark. However, their sense of hearing is quite frightening.\n\nOften, I find groups of other survivors here in Louisville. All with the same goal in mind: to survive. Some are good, and some are just plain horrible.\n\nOne night, I had no choice. It wasn't my fault; I know I shouldn't have, but I had no choice! I was stupid enough to infiltrate another group's stash house. because I thought they weren't home. This group isn't the greatest of people or the brightest. They often harass or, on rare occasions, kill other survivors for their supplies. Anyway, here I was, inside, and I managed to picklock their backdoor with ease. It was dark; that's smart. They kept their lights off. However, my eyesight is fair in the dark. A few doors down, I found their stash, and I packed up what I could take with me. Make sure everything is as it should be. I lock the door as if no one has ever passed by. That was when I heard someone crying at the door next to their stash. I opened it, and inside was a woman who was chained to a pipe. She notices me and begins to panic. I do my best to calm her down. However, I heard gunshots downstairs and something along the lines of "Shit, they're insidious, Carl, get the fucking guns, man!", I knew then that the zombies had gotten inside their safe place. I couldn't free the woman. I had nothing on me, and I knew I had little time on my hands. With little to no choice, I chose to stay alive and safe. I apologized to her and closed the door, muffling her screams.\n\nI ran back home.\n\nNow, most of you will think of me as a suicidal monster. The world has gone to shit; everyone is out for themselves. Why should I care what others think? I want to survive. By any means necessary.\n\nA couple of days ago, I had to kill a teenage boy. Because he had spotted me looting a vehicle from another group. He was about to alarm his group when I stabbed him straight through his windpipe with my makeshift wooden spear. I did not hesitate, nor did I care. I needed to survive and wasn't going to let some little shit be the end of me. However, another set of eyes witnessed what I had done and screamed for help. A pack of wolves was soon upon me, a mere rat in their eyes. Luckily, I had some grenades I managed to snatch from a military vehicle a night ago. I removed the pins from a few of them and threatened to go with everyone. They couldn't see my face as It was covered with a bandana. So all they did was shout out names like "Damn filthy rat!". Let's just say I ended up leaving alive that day.\n\nLittle did I know that the boy's death would come back to haunt me.\nLiterally.\n\n(Bloody footprints are covering some of the words but are still readable.)\nbecause I sit here now. Writing this.\nThis morning, I thought of looting in broad daylight. A huge mistake, I know. A rat going out in the morning instead of the night. That same group was looting one of my favorite hotels for supplies. I snuck up behind one of them and slit their throat. It was a young woman. The others had left already, it seemed to me. So I began to loot the place and her body. Who the fuck knew that these freaks would carry around their dead like pets? This undead motherfucker snuck up behind me, taking a chunk from my neck. It was the kid that I had killed days ago.\n\nShit luck, am I right? Well, I know I won't live long now. Well, at least the next set of survivors that find my place will have something. Leaving my stash behind.\nDon't bother looking for me. I'll be long dead if I'm going to die. I'll die with those fuckers; I know where they eat and shit.\n\nTip to future survivors Don't get cocky like I did. It will cost you.",

Just wanted to let you know that I'm okay, despite everything that's been going down these past few days. I normally wouldn't have this much time to write, but our wing's on lockdown today. Can't separate the truth from the con talk these days, but what I do know is some sicko was caught eating his cellmate. We all saw the guy, covered in blood and grayer than the cold, hard concrete beneath our toes, getting wheeled out by the COs strapped to those chairs that they put Hannibal Lecter in. Yeah, straight out of the Silence of the Lambs movie, mask and all. I didn't know they actually had stuff like that! If he ever leaves the hole, which I sure as hell hope he doesn't, he'll be taking the nickname "Hannibal the Cannibal" to his grave. At least I have my trial date coming up this Friday; maybe the appeal will finally go through and you and I will get to hang out and go fishing again like the good old days. They keep delaying it, though, probably because of this new bug everyone's so afraid of now. I think it's another one of those bird flu things they sometimes talk about on TV; it's bad enough that they've\neven got the army enforcing a quarantine around all of Knox County. Some cons in here are swearing on their own mothers that they knew so-and-so who caught this mystery bug, and that now they're in and out the infirmary running a really nasty fever. I wish they were lying, but more and more guys in here have been getting sick lately. Even a few COs are clocking out early saying they've got the "Knox bug". And you won't believe the kind of rumors this one nutjob is spreading around here about it. The guy's saying old Hannibal had the bug before anybody else, and that it's what caused him to lose his marbles and do what he did to his poor celly, like rabies or something. He rants on and on all night about how everyone who catches the bug is a ticking time bomb, and it's only a matter of time before we're all just like Hannibal the Cannibal. I told him he needed to stop taking everything he heard on KnoxTalk radio as the gospel of truth, and to zip it before someone less kind than myself landed him in the very same infirmary bed that all the sick folks are coughing, barfing, and vomiting all over. That sure as hell shut him up.\n\nIt's been four or five hours now, and the lockdown still hasn't been lifted. Apparently it's just our cell block anymore, but a total lockdown. Whatever's happening, I just hope the COs at least have the decency to serve us our lunches. Rumors are spreading wild now, and not just from the nutty guy. It seems everyone's got their own idea of why we're still on lockdown, and half of them are hiding under their pillows thinking that Hannibal broke loose and is coming back for seconds. You remember my cellmate, Hugh, the guy who does janitorial work around the jail? I've known Hugh going on for half a year, and he's not one to spout fairytales. He says he was mopping up when a CO, white like she'd seen the boogeyman, ran over and snatched the broomstick right out of his hands before hauling on back the way she came and jabbing it in between the handles of the canteen doors just before a whole lot of hands started banging on them from the other side. Hugh said that was about an hour before the lockdown started; he thinks somebody started a riot in there, and that's what's causing all this. Causing everybody else to miss their breakfast; selfish pricks. Poor Hugh's sick now, too; I just hope it's his seasonal allergies, and not that bug he's got. I'm going to try to get some shut eye.

Rocky got him off me, and the guy was just flopping around on the sidewalk after that, so maybe he was totally high, but, like, dude!? He bit me so hard, and now I'm all messed up! Hope he liked the taste of f!cking silicone! So Rocky's taking me to the doc tomorrow to get some antibiotics or whatever, make sure it's not infected, and maybe fix the damage. He's so sweet. Maybe I'll pick out a new blouse, too! Tomorrow's going to be great!",

It's strange how the little things we took for granted become the things we yearn for the most. I miss the sound of the alarm clock, the rush to get ready for work, and even the annoying morning traffic.\n\nThose mundane routines gave our lives a sense of purpose and normalcy. Now, every day feels like a battle for survival. But I hold onto the hope that one day, Mondays will return, and we'll complain about them just like we used to.",
