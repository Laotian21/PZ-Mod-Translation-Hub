If you sleep outside of it, you lose some schedule integrity. Not sleeping for more than 24 hours also starts to damage your sleep schedule. Mod tracks at which hours you like to sleep by checking the midpoint of your last sleep, so it's possible to shift your schedule to different hours.<br>---Technical description, don't read this if you don't want to meta-game much---<br>Every time you sleep, the mod tracks the midpoint of your sleep. For example, if you sleep between 23:00 and 05:30, the midpoint would be 03:45, and it would be your optimal sleeping hour. If you sleep within +-6 hours of this time, you gain progress to your SleepHealthiness bar, which ranges from -200 to 200. A check is made every 10 minutes, adding +0.167 to the bar if sleeping within the correct schedule, essentially giving +1 for every hour of correct sleep. Sleeping outside this schedule removes 0.167 from the bar every 10 minutes. After not sleeping for more than 24 hours, you start losing -0.167 every ten minutes. If your bar falls below -100, you get Sleepyhead. If it's above 100, you get Wakeful. Starting with either trait sets the starting value of the bar to its maximum or minimum point: +200 for Wakeful and -200 for Sleepyhead",
