Once packed with birthday parties and laser tag battles, the place now sits frozen in time.  
But not everything here is dead: the arcade still hums with life, especially the mysterious TetriZ machines.  
Drop blocks, clear lines, and forget the end of the world — for a little while.

Bowl a frame, dodge some zombies in the laser maze, or just hang by the snack bar.  
Power it up and you might just hear the 80s call back...

It’s weird, it’s loud, and it still runs.  
Just don’t expect to win any prizes.
