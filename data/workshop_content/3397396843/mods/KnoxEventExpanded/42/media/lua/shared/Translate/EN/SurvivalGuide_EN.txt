    " <TEXT> <CENTRE> <SIZE:medium> Where are the npcs? <BR>"..
    " <TEXT> If you are not getting tons of errors, the mod should be working. The npcs in the mod are different in the sense that they do not "orbit" you. They are distributed all over the map depending on the zombie intensity in that area. Aside from that, the npcs (currently) follow a schedule where they patrol around their house and rest during the day, and only rest during the night. The easiest way to find them is to use a walkie-talkie (portable two-way radio) and use the 'Contact nearby survivors'-option. It will mark npc safehouses on your map.<BR><BR>"..
    " <TEXT> <CENTRE> <SIZE:medium> Why can't I attack the NPCs? <BR> <TEXT> The way the mod is implemented, you will automatically be able to attack NPCs that are hostile towards you.<BR>"..
    "To override this, there is a red icon to the left of the screen with two crossed axes and a lock. That means PvP is off i.e. you cannot attack the npcs. Pressing the icon or pressing G will enable PvP. The hotkey, G, can also be changed in options.<BR><BR>"..
    " <TEXT> <CENTRE> <SIZE:medium> What is "relationship"? <BR> <TEXT> Npcs have relationship with you and other npcs they encounter (or have encountered). It is a number between -100 and 100 that controls how much they like you or other npcs. The number itself is a sum of all positive and negative memories a npc has about another npc. Having good conversations with npcs typically increases relationship while insulting them or fighting them decreases it. These effects all fade over time as well. Some npcs e.g. soldiers will always see you as hostile (for now).<BR>"..

    " <TEXT> You can ask a npc to join you by right-clicking them and selecting the "Speak" option. Under the suboption "About their group", you can either ask them to join your group, or ask if their entire group wants to join. <BR> If they don't accept, the peaceful option is to speak with them regularly, until they decide to join you. Beware, they don't take kindly being asked to join you too often. If you want a more violent route, you can opt to take out some of the group members to increase the chance of them joining you.<BR><BR>"..
